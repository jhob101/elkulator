# Elkulator v2.0 for Windows and Linux.

Introduction
============

Elkulator is an Acorn Electron emulator for Windows and Linux.  It was originally
written by Sarah Walker and has many community contirbutions since (see below).

Elkulator is licensed under the GPL, see COPYING for more details.

# ROMs

**The basic ROMs for emulation are included with the source.**

However, if for some reason they are missing the the ROMs required by Elkulator can be
obtained from the 1.0 release of the emulator, available from 
http://elkulator.acornelectron.co.uk/ElkulatorV1.0Linux.tar.gz

Once downloaded simply unpack the contents of the above archive to a new 
directory and copy the `roms` directory it contains to the root of this
repository:

```
  mkdir temp
  wget http://elkulator.acornelectron.co.uk/ElkulatorV1.0Linux.tar.gz
  cd temp
  tar zxf ../ElkulatorV1.0Linux.tar.gz
  cd ..
  cp -r temp/roms .
```

# Compiling

With version 2, Elkulator now compiles against the current Allegro5 libraries.  This
replaces the much older allegro4 and allows easier multi platform support.

## Windows

To build windows you will first need to install MSYS2 (TODO: Instructions for MSYS2 install).

Then open a MSYS2 command window and you will need to install the following:

```
pacman -S git mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-gcc mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-allegro make libtool automake autoconf mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-freealut
```
To configure and build Elkulator, open a terminal window, navigate to the
Elkulator directory then enter

```
  ./scripts/autoconfigure.sh
```

To build enter: 

```
  make
```

If this is successful then you should be able to run the emulator:

```
  ./elkulator.exe
```
 
## Linux (Ubuntu and Debian based distros)

You will need the following libraries:

- Allegro 5.x
- OpenAL
- ALut
- Zlib

On a Debian system you should be able to install these by invoking the
following command in a terminal window:

```
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install automake liballegro5-dev liballegro-acodec5-dev \
    liballegro-audio5-dev liballegro-dialog5-dev liballegro-image5-dev \
    zlib1g-dev libalut-dev libopenal-dev
```

(The acodec, audio, dialog and image addon `-dev` packages are only
`Recommends` of `liballegro5-dev`, so they are pulled in automatically by a
default apt configuration but skipped under `--no-install-recommends`. They are
listed explicitly above so the build works regardless of your apt settings.)

To configure and build Elkulator, open a terminal window, navigate to the
Elkulator directory then enter

```
  ./scripts/autoconfigure.sh
```

To build enter: 

```
  make
```

If this is successful then you should be able to run the emulator:

```
  ./elkulator
```

## Linux (Fedora 40 and above)

You will need the following libraries:

- Allegro 5.x
- OpenAL
- ALut
- Zlib

On a Fedora system you should be able to install these by invoking the
following command in a terminal window:

```
  sudo dnf install automake allegro5-devel allegro5-addon-dialog-devel allegro5-addon-audio-devel allegro5-addon-acodec-devel allegro5-addon-image-devel allegro5-addon-video-devel openal-devel freealut-devel zlib-devel 
```

To configure and build Elkulator, open a terminal window, navigate to the
Elkulator directory then enter

```
  ./scripts/autoconfigure.sh
```

To build enter: 

```
  make
```

If this is successful then you should be able to run the emulator:

```
  ./elkulator
```

## Linux (Legacy Allegro4 build - Ubuntu and debian based distros)

Elkulator can still be compiled against allegro4 for reference, allthough this will
be deprecated soon.

You will need the following libraries:

- Allegro 4.x
- OpenAL
- ALut
- Zlib

On a Debian system you should be able to install these by invoking the
following command in a terminal window:

```
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install automake liballegro4-dev zlib1g-dev libalut-dev libopenal-dev aclocal
```

To configure and build Elkulator, open a terminal window, navigate to the
Elkulator directory then enter

```
  ./scripts/autoconfigure.sh --enable-allegro4
```

To build enter: 

```
  make
```

If this is successful then you should be able to run the emulator:

```
  ./elkulator
```


Elkulator has been tested on x86-32 and x86-64 machines. No other architecture
is guaranteed to work, and big-endian machines (eg PowerPC) almost certainly
won't work.


## Linux (Legacy) Specifics

Due to the limitations of the allegro4 libraries on linus, the menu is not
available all the time. Press the Menu or F11 keys to open it,
then Menu or F11 to close it again. (Where available, the Menu key is
typically found between the space bar and right Ctrl key, depicting an
application menu on the keycap. It is not a Windows key).

The debugger is only available via the command line.

Hardware line doubling mode is not available on Linux.

Risizing of the Elkulator Window is not available, and full screen mode
does not expand the size of the actual Electron screen.

Video performance is noticeably slower than on Windows. This is largely due to
the lack of hardware acceleration support in Elkulator.

# Turbo boards

Elkulator can emulate an Elektuur/Slogger turbo board. This board replaces the lower
8k of RAM in the system with the faster RAM on the board. This has the effect of speeding
up most of the system, as most OS workspace is in this lower 8k, along with the stack.
However, it can have some slight compatibility problems - the Electron ULA can't display 
anything from this area, and some timing sensitive games (eg Firetrack) will mess up.

Elkulator can also emulate a Slogger/Jafa Master RAM board. This is a far more ambitious
afair, attempting to replace all the Electron memory. It has three modes :

- Off - Disabled. Same as a normal Electron.
- Turbo - Same as the above turbo board - only replaces 8k.
- Shadow - As above, but also shadows the screen memory. The screen is left in normal memory,
         and BASIC works with the 'shadow memory' on the board. The computer boasts this as
         '64k mode'. This means that you can use up to 28k in BASIC in all modes, and it runs
         noticeably faster as well. This mode is incompatible with almost all games though.


# FAQ

Q : How do I run a game?
A : Load the UEF file through the tape menu. Then, at the > prompt, type
    CHAIN"" (for most games. A few will need *RUN).

Q : Why is the 2xSaI filter so slow?
A : The code itself isn't terribly fast to start with, but due to my lazyness,
    the screen rendering code is still in 8-bit, so Elkulator has to perform
    an 8-bit to 16-bit conversion every frame.

Q : Why is the PAL filter even slower?
A : The PAL filter is actually doing a lot of work - processing 3 16mhz data streams.
    It's made worse by my inability to optimise it properly.
